# RobotController
NodeMCU folder for the board code.
Android for the app.

If cloning, don't forget to change the SSID, PASSWORD, ip, port and mask to yours in the NodeMCU's code. Android's code needs the ip/port of the NodeMCU.

Parts needed:
NodeMCU, 3.3V Regulator, Battery (We've used 6 AA batteries which gave us total of 7V), H Bridge, 2 Engines and a car to connect to.
